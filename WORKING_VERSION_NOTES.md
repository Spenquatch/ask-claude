# Working Version Notes

## Working Version (12:12-12:13 timestamp)
- MCP auto-approval system is functioning correctly
- Approval server is being configured and started by Claude
- Sequential thinking tool is being approved
- 20 events received successfully
- Process completed in ~60 seconds (just under timeout)
- NO ERRORS

## Changes Made After Working Version
1. Added debug logging to cli_tool.py to see event types
2. Added multiple event handlers in cli_tool.py:
   - "content" in event
   - event_type == "text" 
   - event_type == "content_block_delta"
   - event_type == "assistant" (this is the right one!)
3. Added command logging in claude_code_wrapper.py
4. Changed logger.debug to logger.info for MCP config

## What Broke
After these changes, the process started timing out (code 143) instead of completing successfully.

## Debug Output From Verbose Run Shows
```
[DEBUG] Event type: system, Keys: ['type', 'subtype', 'session_id', 'tools', 'mcp_servers']
[DEBUG] Event type: assistant, Keys: ['type', 'message', 'session_id']
[DEBUG] Event type: user, Keys: ['type', 'message', 'session_id']
```

The events are "assistant" type with "message" key - that's what contains the content!

## Critical Difference
- Working version: Completed in ~60 seconds with 20 events
- Broken version: Times out at exactly 60 seconds with 19 events

Something we changed is making the process slower or stuck, causing it to hit the timeout.
